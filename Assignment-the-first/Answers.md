# Assignment the First

## Part 1
1. Be sure to upload your Python script. Provide a link to it here (use the relative path "./script.py"):

| File name | label | Read length | Phred encoding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz |  read1 | 101 | +33 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | index R1 | 8 | +33 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | index R2 | 8 | +33 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | read 2 | 101 | +33 |

## Part 2
1. Define the problem

   We have 4 files: read 1, index 1, read 2, and index 2. Read 1 corresponds with index 1 and read 2 corresponds with index2. I want to filter though each file and first check the quality score. If the score if below the threshold I assigned I will put it in an unknown file output. After quality filtering through each sequence and index, I will open all four files and go through each record and combine the record for read 1 and read 2 (example â€œAAAAAAAA-CCCCCCCC") at the end of the header for both read 1 and read 2. If the barcodes match, those records will go into output files for 'dual matched', if they do not match they will go into output 'index-hopped', and if the barcode is not one of the 24 known barcodes listed, it will go into output files 'unknown index'. 
   
3. Describe output

   I will have a total of 52 output FASTQ files.

   There will be 48 FASTQ files for dual matched barcodes. There are 24 different known barcodes, and each barcode will have 2 files: one for read 1 and one for read 2 (the name of the file for the first barcode will be barcode1_read1.fastq and barcode1_read2.fastq).

   There will be 2 FASTQ files for the index-hopped reads-pairs, one for read 1 and one for read 2 (the name of the file for hopped barcode would be hopped_read1.fastq and hopped_read2.fastq).

   There will be 2 FASTQ files for the unknown barcode records or low quality score records, one for read 1 and one for read 2 (the name of the file for undetermined barcode would be undetermined_read1.fastq and undetermined_read2.fastq). 
   
5. Upload your [4 input FASTQ files](../TEST-input_FASTQ) and your [>=6 expected output FASTQ files](../TEST-output_FASTQ).

6. Pseudocode

   argparse for 5 variables: 4 files and the quality score threshold

   open all 4 files `with open() as f1, open() as f2, open() as f3, open() as f4`

   `while true` loop

   read line for each of the 4 files at once

   `if` all four lines are false (empty newline) then break the loop

   *the rest of this code will run if the lines are not empty and we are still in the loop*

   strip the line (to get rid of new line at the end)

   then get the barcode for `file 2` and `file 3` (the index files)

   check the quality score of the barcodes by calling the phred_score function that I will make/call from bioinfo.py
   
    `if` the barcodes are below the quality score `<` (regardless of if they are hopped, matched, or not)
   
     combine the barcodes into one string

     append that to the end of each header

     output it into a file `using with open('a')` named `undetermined_read1.fastq` and `undetermined_read2.fastq`

   *this code will run if the barcodes are not below the quality score threshold*
   
   - `if` the barcodes are the same as each other `==` `and` part of the 24 barcodes

     combine the barcodes into one string

     append that to the end of each header

     output it into a file `using with open('a')` named `barcode<x>_read1.fastq` and `barcode<x>_read2.fastq` where <x> is the number of the barcode
     
   - `if` the barcodes are different `=!` `and` part of the 24 barcodes

     combine the barcodes into one string

     append that to the end of each header

     output it into a file `using with open('a')` named `hopped_read1.fastq` and `hopped_read2.fastq`
     
   - `if` the barcodes are not part of the 24 barcodes
     combine the barcodes into one string

     append that to the end of each header

     output it into a file `using with open('a')` named `undetermined_read1.fastq` and `undetermined_read2.fastq`
   

8. High level functions. For each function, be sure to include:
    1. Description/doc string
    2. Function headers (name and parameters)
    3. Test examples for individual functions
    4. Return statement
